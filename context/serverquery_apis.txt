ServerQuery is the successor to ihasTaco's ServerStatus, and while it was a good bot, it was not great.

ServerQuery is fully customizable to suit your needs and the servers personality!

ServerQuery can query many different types of server using a few different Query API's
A2S (Valves Steam Query Protocol)
FiveM (for querying FiveM and RedM servers)
MCStatus (for querying Minecraft Java and Bedrock servers)
SAMP (for querying Grand theft Auto San Andreas servers)

with plans to support a few more:
ASE
GameSpy 1, 2, & 3
Doom 3
Nadeo
Quake 2, & 3
Unreal 2
RageMP
Terrarria
Roblox
Teamspeak
