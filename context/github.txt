ChatDSA is an Open-Source project, and can be found here: https://github.com/ihasTaco/ChatDSA
ChatDSA is a Discord Chat Bot using chatGPT that is used to help new members get familiar with the Royal Productions Discord server, as well give users relevant information about servers

ihasTaco is thinking about using the information from his ServerQuery bot to present player information and server status to users

ihasTaco has a few projects on his GitHub (https://github.com/ihasTaco/) including his beloved ServerQuery, 
that you can actually see in use right now by visiting any of the server info channels like <#1080641527564476446>

ihasTaco has no other projects in the github besides ServerQuery and ChatDSA
